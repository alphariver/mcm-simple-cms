MCM Simple CMS is an easy to install and use simple content managment system (CMS) developed in PHP and MySQL.

Why another CMS?
So many other PHP/MySQL (and other) CMSs are bloated, slow, overly complex, and difficult to modify.

Mcmsimplecms for PHP is simpler than a certain car insurance company's website :)
